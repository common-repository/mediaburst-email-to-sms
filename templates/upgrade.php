    <h3>Upgrade to Clockwork</h3>
    <p>We recognise free email to SMS gateways don't meet everyone's needs. They are provided by the networks, can be unreliable, and don't cover a wide range of countries.</p>
    <p><a href="http://www.clockworksms.com/">Clockwork SMS</a> is a paid SMS gateway. We charge 5p per SMS in the UK, and deliver to over 900 networks in over 200 countries worldwide - view our latest worldwide <a href="http://www.clockworksms.com/pricing/">coverage and pricing</a>.</p>
    <p>You can upgrade this plugin today. It's free to upgrade - you only pay for the SMS messages you send to your subscribers. This also simplifies the widget so that instead of having to choose their country and network, your visitors just have to enter their phone number - and we do the rest.</p>
